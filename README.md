# DataAnalytics-Assessment
**QUESTION 1**
To answer the question, I created a query to look for customers who both have a Savings and an Investment plan. I approached this from data analysis and customer value segmentation, with the aim of determining high-value active customers with multiple financial products.
One difficulty I encountered was that the problem did not specify whether to take into account active plans only or all of them in history. In order to avoid the elimination of valuable data and to keep the in-depth analysis, I decided to consider all of the plans, regardless of their status. This was done to allow for wider business insights, such as cross-sell possibilities and long-term customer interaction.
