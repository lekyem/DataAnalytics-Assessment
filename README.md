# DataAnalytics-Assessment
**QUESTION 1**
To answer the question, I created a query to look for customers who both have a Savings and an Investment plan. I approached this from data analysis and customer value segmentation, with the aim of determining high-value active customers with multiple financial products.
One difficulty I encountered was that the problem did not specify whether to take into account active plans only or all of them in history. In order to avoid the elimination of valuable data and to keep the in-depth analysis, I decided to consider all of the plans, regardless of their status. This was done to allow for wider business insights, such as cross-sell possibilities and long-term customer interaction.

**QUESTION 2**
To answer the frequency analysis question, I developed a query to calculate the average number of transactions per customer per month and segment customers based on their transaction activity. The core objective was to categorize customers into High, Medium, or Low frequency users and return the total number of customers in each group along with their average monthly transaction volume.
Given that the question did not specify a particular time frame or definition of frequency, one of the key challenges was determining an appropriate analysis period. To address this, I grouped transactions by customer and month, using the DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') function to normalize the dates into monthly buckets.
The query first calculates the monthly transaction count for each customer and groups it by user and month. Then, it determines the average number of transactions per month for each customer across all available months. Based on this average, customers are assigned a frequency category using a CASE statement. The final output aggregates the data to show the total number of customers in each category and the average of their average monthly transactions.
This approach allowed me to provide a structured view of customer engagement through transaction behavior, which can be extremely valuable for segmentation, targeted campaigns, and understanding usage patterns.
